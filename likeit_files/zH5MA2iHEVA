You just need 12-16 sheets of rectangular paper.\nBig rectangle=BIG pompoms. Small rectangle=small pompoms.\n*Here in the Philippines we call it Japanese paper (don't even ask me why because I don't know as well. lol) But it is similar to tissue paper that can be found at craft stores, book stores and stationery stores. If you really can't find it, just use crepe paper. :)\n\n\nFor the origami flowers :\nI measured the paper that I used. its 3 inches X 3 inches. If you want bigger or smaller flower, simple adjust the size of your square paper.. :)\nUse thin paper so that folding will be easier. I tried this with thick construction paper, it was so difficult to fold.\n\nI hope those info help you! :)\n\nMy nails in the video :\n\n1st : http://www.realasianbeauty.com/2013/05/mani-monday-revlon-85-minted-nail-polish.html\n\n2nd :\n\n_______________________\n\nHello, everyone! :)\n\nThe last time I did a DIY decoration video, so many of you liked it so I decided to alternate nail, hair tutorial, and then diy videos. \nSo please expect a lot of diy's soon!
